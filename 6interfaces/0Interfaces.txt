########## INTERFACES #############

 * Description:
 	- One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have.
	 In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code.
 * Help you to prevents typos at your properties
 * optional properties -> wonderful `?` character
 * Readonly properties -> no modify properties after object is created
 * Readonly vs Const -> Variable const, Property readOnly
 * Extra property 
 * Function types: This is a function declaration with only the parameter list and return type given. 
 * Class types: Get a contract with the interface
 * Extending interfaces: Like classes interfaces can extend each others. That give you more flexibility to get reusable components
